Practise the piano, but on your keyboard. 

Are you bored of replying to emails? Want a break from cracking the code? Why not train to play tunes like Yankee Doodle, Twinkle Twinkle and Happy birthday to impress your friends on the next zoom call?

This is a basic JS keyboard for you to practise, you can even test how accurate you are and get feedback!
